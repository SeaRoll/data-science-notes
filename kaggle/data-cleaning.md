# Data cleaning for ML
Data cleaning is a key part of data science, but it can be deeply frustrating. 
Why are some of your text fields garbled? What should you do about those missing values? 
Why arenâ€™t your dates formatted correctly? How can you quickly clean up inconsistent data entry?

## Handling missing values

```python
# get the number of missing data points per column
missing_values_count = nfl_data.isnull().sum()
```

```python
# how many total missing values do we have?
total_cells = np.product(nfl_data.shape)
total_missing = missing_values_count.sum()

# percent of data that is missing
percent_missing = (total_missing/total_cells) * 100
print(percent_missing)
```

*remember, Is this value missing because it wasn't recorded or because it doesn't exist?*

```python
# remove all the rows that contain a missing value
nfl_data.dropna()

# remove all columns with at least one missing value
columns_with_na_dropped = nfl_data.dropna(axis=1)

# replace all NA's with 0
subset_nfl_data.fillna(0)
```
